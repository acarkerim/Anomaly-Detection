# Anomaly Detection in Factoring Transactions

This repository is created to present my [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/acarkerim/Anomaly-Detection/blob/master/AnomalyDetectionProject.pdf) of the [Master's Degree in Big Data Analytics](https://bda.mef.edu.tr/en#gsc.tab=0) guided by Ozgur Ozluk, PhD.


## Abstract

In this study, anomaly detection model performed by using 3 different approaches on factoring dataset which consist of 890.118 observations and 122 features provided by one of the leading factoring companies in Turkey. In this respect, it is aimed to determine whether the checks brought to the factoring company are fraud or not. In order to enable the company to take precaution against such crimes in a fast and rapid manner, statistics, density and machine learning based algorithms are used and these algorithms are evaluated according to the highest accuracy score and working speed results. Mahalanobis distance, which is a rule-based approach, is strengthened with minimum covariance determinant and gives the fastest result compared to other approaches. In line with the use of this algorithm, the accuracy score threshold determined by the company is achieved. The highest accuracy score is obtained by using the Isolation Forest algorithm, however this algorithm is very slow when it is compared to other algorithms. The density-based anomaly detection algorithm scores below the threshold specified by the company and it operates relatively slow.
